  \begin{verse}
    \[Bm]Closed my door, forgot my key
    Missed my bus in the pouring rain
    It's \[G]been the usual Su\[D]nday with a flu \[Bm]
    \[G]And I just can't \[D]get over you \[Bm]
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Burnt my toast and lost your number
    Cut my finger, spilled my beer
    It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
    And I just can't get over you
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    I \[G]put your stockings
    \[D]In my purple boots \[Bm]
    \[G]What if I do\[D]n't get over you? \[Bm]
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Had a chat and left my hat
    Ate my dog and walked my cat
    It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
    And I just can't get over you
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Called a cabbage, threw the garbage
    Asked for help and got some kelp
    It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
    And I just can't get over you
